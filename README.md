# PixelCorruption
Ludum Dare #33 - You are the Monster. -  Corrupt the world's images. 

Destroy your own image (Legal: will not actually destroy any image you load into the game). A 'classic' side-scrolling shoot'em up (shmup) where you destroy the pixel bits of your own image or the default one. Runs best in Google Chrome (Firefox - bit choppy).

NOTE: Don't load images larger than 256x256... will result in some fun stuff... like screens not showing properly... or if its a large image tons of 'loading' time in the beginning. 

Also NOTE:  Your images do NOT get uploaded anywhere they are only loaded into the browser for processing on the client side. 

Controls:

Movement - aswd and/or arrows
Shoot - Spacebar

The game will take your image process its pixels and out put a unique game for your entertainment.  It will take a count of how many pixels you have destroyed and of what color.  In the end it will show you how destroying those pixels affected your image.
